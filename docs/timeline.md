# Grok-Local Project Timeline and Goals

## Timeline
- **Pre-Feb 2025**: Project inception as a CLI agent managing `safe/` files and Git ops with Deepseek-R1/Llama3.2.
- **Feb 27, 2025**: 
  - Shifted file ops to `local/` for a cleaner root.
  - Added delegation to Grok 3 (e.g., `spaceship_fuel.py`).
  - `x_poller.py` went offline due to X login issues.
  - Checkpointing matured with `restore --file` and `checkpoint --file`.
- **Feb 28, 2025**: 
  - Grok 3 took lead, updated `restart_grok_local_dev_chat.py` with meta-description.
  - Planned `x_poller.py` fix, documentation, and help options.
  - Current state: `safe/` has `test2.txt`, `test3.txt`, etc.; `local/` has `spaceship_fuel.py`.

## Goals
### Short-Term (Mar 2025)
- **Fix `x_poller.py`**: Restore X polling with a robust, headless login flow. Test locally first to avoid spamming X.
- **Documentation**: Establish `docs/` with `timeline.md` and expand to usage guides.
- **Usability**: Add `-h/--help` to all scripts (`grok_local.py`, `grok_checkpoint.py`, `x_poller.py`).
- **Git Hardening**: Strengthen `git_commit_and_push` for reliable updates.

### Mid-Term (Apr-May 2025)
- **Checkpoint Management**: Implement `list checkpoints` command.
- **Interactive Mode**: Replace Ctrl+D/Z with a keyword (e.g., `done`) for delegation input.
- **Testing**: Expand `test_grok_local.py` with edge cases (Git conflicts, file permissions).

### Long-Term (Jun 2025+)
- **Autonomous Problem Solving**: Enable `grok_local` to detect and fix login (e.g., X auth) or Git issues (e.g., upstream errors) autonomously.
- **Multi-Agent Sync**: Enhance X polling and direct agent communication for seamless collaboration.
- **Scalability**: Support larger repos and complex workflows with automated cleanup and state management.

## Notes
- Regular Git commits are criticalâ€”push often to `git@github.com:imars/grok-local.git`.
- All file ops must output in `cat << 'EOF' > local/<file>` format for usability.
- `x_poller.py` testing should use mocks or a sandbox to protect X from untested code.
