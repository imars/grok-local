Its purpose is to prepare the body, increase blood flow to muscles, and improve performance by gradually raising the heart rate and activating the central nervous system.\n\n### Types of Warm-Ups:\n1. **Cardiovascular**:  \n   - Running in place  \n   - Jumping jacks  \n   - Shadow boxing  \n   - Jump rope  \n\n2. **Stretching**:  \n   - Static stretches (e.g., leg swings, seated forward fold)  \n   - Dynamic stretches (e.g., high knees, arm circles)  \n\n3. **Calisthenics**:  \n   - Push-ups  \n   - Squat-to-stand  \n   - Plank variations  \n\n4. **Yoga-inspired**:  \n   - Sun salutations  \n   - Cat-cow stretch  \n\n5. **Cross-training**:  \n   - Combining different movements for a holistic warm-up  \n\n### Benefits of Warm-Ups:\n- Prevents injury by preparing muscles and tendons.\n- Gradually increases heart rate, reducing the risk of sudden cardiac arrest.\n- Enhances mental focus and physical readiness.\n\n### Duration:\n- For moderate activities (e.g., walking), 5â€“10 minutes.  \n- For vigorous activities (e.g., running), 10â€“15 minutes.\n\n### Considerations:\n- Start with a low-intensity warm-up to avoid overexertion.\n- Listen to your body; stop if you feel discomfort or dizziness.\n\n**Example Warm-Up Routine**:  \n1. **5 minutes**: High knees and arm swings (2 sets of 20)  \n2. **5 minutes**: Jumping jacks and side lunges  \n3. **5 minutes**: Seated forward fold and leg swings  \n4. **5 minutes**: Plank to standing and push-ups  \n\nLet me know if you'd like a more detailed routine or specific exercises! ðŸ˜Š","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128011,96375,5352,128012,128013,271,128014,271,334,96375,47197,334,2355,32,8369,5352,374,264,10073,5382,5820,477,10368,2884,1603,23387,304,264,810,19428,5820,477,3465,13,11699,7580,374,311,10772,279,2547,11,5376,6680,6530,311,24569,11,323,7417,5178,555,27115,19054,279,4851,4478,323,72192,279,8792,23418,1887,382,14711,21431,315,46863,35681,1725,512,16,13,3146,5889,822,33945,96618,2355,256,482,29125,304,2035,2355,256,482,29888,287,503,7977,2355,256,482,25284,46329,2355,256,482,29888,34520,19124,17,13,3146,54998,287,96618,2355,256,482,23977,50699,320,68,1326,2637,2531,57890,11,47413,4741,11816,8,2355,256,482,22648,50699,320,68,1326,2637,1579,31624,11,6916,26432,8,19124,18,13,3146,9027,380,12301,1233,96618,2355,256,482,23804,27859,2355,256,482,20685,266,4791,12,2752,2355,256,482,1856,1201,27339,19124,19,13,3146,56,14361,53161,96618,2355,256,482,8219,4371,83241,2355,256,482,17810,1824,363,14841,19124,20,13,3146,29601,86470,96618,2355,256,482,23262,5859,2204,19567,369,264,61876,8369,5352,19124,14711,39195,315,46863,35681,1725,512,12,39168,82,11134,555,20646,24569,323,8541,2439,627,12,22547,1870,12992,4851,4478,11,18189,279,5326,315,11210,47345,8163,627,12,29757,3095,10723,5357,323,7106,62792,382,14711,21722,512,12,1789,24070,7640,320,68,1326,2637,11689,705,220,20,4235,605,4520,13,2355,12,1789,71920,7640,320,68,1326,2637,4401,705,220,605,4235,868,4520,382,14711,21829,811,512,12,5256,449,264,3428,20653,8127,8369,5352,311,5766,927,327,531,290,627,12,33249,311,701,2547,26,3009,422,499,2733,44776,477,294,97745,382,334,13617,46863,47197,72162,96618,2355,16,13,3146,20,4520,96618,5234,31624,323,6916,57890,320,17,7437,315,220,508,8,2355,17,13,3146,20,4520,96618,29888,287,503,7977,323,3185,21271,288,2355,18,13,3146,20,4520,96618,1369,660,4741,11816,323,2531,57890,2355,19,13,3146,20,4520,96618,1856,1201,311,11509,323,4585,27859,19124,10267,757,1440,422,499,4265,1093,264,810,11944,14348,477,3230,23783,0,27623,232],"total_duration":156513935926,"load_duration":9223803553,"prompt_eval_count":5,"prompt_eval_duration":3131000000,"eval_count":404,"eval_duration":144156000000}[GIN] 2025/03/07 - 19:06:15 | 200 |     123.634Âµs |       127.0.0.1 | HEAD     "/"
