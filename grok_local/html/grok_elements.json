    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this HTML snippet from Grok and figure out where the user would input their prompt, submit it, and receive a response. Let me look at the code they provided.\n\nFirst, I see the HTML structure starts with some meta tags for content type, then there's a script tag. The script seems to involve variables like r and t, which are likely used in clickjacking scripts. They have a window.__CF$cv$params object where r is set to '91aebcc32d7563d8' and t to 'MTc0MTA2MzY2NS4wMDAwMDA='. There's an anonymous function creating a script, but it's cut off. The variable 'a' is a document element of type script.\n\nLooking at the elements, I don't see any obvious text inputs or buttons in the snippet itself. It seems like this might be part of a larger application where the actual input field and button are elsewhere on the page not shown here. Without seeing those parts, it's hard to pinpoint their selectors.\n\nSince the prompt input is typically an <input> tag with type \"text\", I'd look for that in the HTML. The submit button would usually be within a form, so maybe a button or form element with type=\"submit\". For the response output, there might be a pre tag or similar used to display results.\n\nWithout more context, it's challenging to provide accurate selectors. Maybe they're using Grok's built-in elements or some custom script that creates these elements dynamically. If I had access to the full HTML document, I could look for those specific tags and attributes.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided HTML snippet from Grok.com, here is an analysis:\n\n### Analysis of the HTML Snippet\nThe HTML snippet shows a JavaScript object with clickjacking parameters (r: '91aebcc32d7563d8' and t: 'MTc0MTA2MzY2NS4wMDAwMDA='). There's no visible text input field or submit button in the provided code. The script seems to be trying to create a new `script` element but is incomplete.\n\n### Recommendations\nWithout more context, it's difficult to provide exact selectors for the prompt input and submit button. However, here are some general recommendations:\n\n- **Prompt Input (where to enter text)**:\n  - Likely an `<input>` tag with type=\"text\". Look for a text field in your application where users can enter their prompts.\n  \n- **Submit Button (to send the prompt)**:\n  - Likely a button within a form, possibly with `type=\"submit\"` or within a form element. Check for buttons labeled \"Submit\" or part of a form.\n\n- **Response Output (where the answer appears)**:\n  - Likely a `<pre>` tag or similar structure used to display output text in web applications.\n\n### Example JSON Response\n```json\n{\n  \"promptInput\": {\n    \"tag\": \"input\",\n    \"type\": \"text\"\n  },\n  \"submitButton\": {\n    \"tag\": \"button\",\n    \"class\": \"\"\n    // Add any relevant class names or attributes if known\n  },\n  \"responseOutput\": {\n    \"tag\": \"pre\",\n    // Optional: add any specific classes used for displaying output\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you can provide more context about the elements present in your application, I can refine these selectors further."
