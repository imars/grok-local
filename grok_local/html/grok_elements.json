    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this HTML snippet from grok.com. The user wants me to identify elements related to prompting, submitting, and displaying responses.\n\nFirst, I see a comment about being saved from \"0011)about:blank\", which might be part of an old URL format. That's probably not relevant here.\n\nThe main content starts with the DOCTYPE html, head, and body tags. In the head section, there are meta tags for content type and a script tag that defines some variables using window.__CF$cv$params. This seems like an AJAX or client-side script setup.\n\nLooking at the scripts, I see two sources: one from grok.com's CDN and another with specific parameters r and t. The r parameter has a unique identifier \"91aebcc32d7563d8\", which might be a CSRF token used for security in form submissions. This is likely an external script that handles form data.\n\nIn the body, there are no visible elements like divs or spans with any styling (like classes ending with ' style=' '). However, since it's within the HTML structure, all elements should technically have attributes and text content.\n\nSince I can't see any tags in the snippet provided, my best guess is that these scripts handle form submission. The external script might trigger a form submission when certain parameters are met, like the CSRF token validation with \"r='91aebcc32d7563d8'\".\n\nFor the prompt input, it's probably entered somewhere outside this snippet but likely within an HTML element not shown here. Similarly, the submit button would be another hidden element that triggers when the form is ready.\n\nThe response output isn't visible in this code either. It might use a pre tag or have some inline CSS to display text without being wrapped in tags.\n\nIn conclusion, I can't see any specific selectors for prompt input, submit buttons, or outputs within this HTML snippet. The functionality must be handled externally through JavaScript and HTML elements not shown here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prompt_input\": null,\n  \"submit_button\": null,\n  \"response_output\": null\n}\n```\n\nThe provided HTML snippet does not contain any visible DOM elements such as `<input>`, `<button>`, or `<div>` with specific styling (i.e., ending in ` style=' '`). This suggests that the prompt input, submit button, and response output functionality may be implemented externally within JavaScript or through some other means outside of this HTML snippet.\n\nSince there are no visible DOM elements matching your criteria, it's likely that these elements would appear elsewhere in a complete application but cannot be identified from this specific snippet alone."
