    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to extract the necessary HTML elements from this snippet. The user provided an HTML string with some inline JavaScript and a script tag pointing to grok.com. They want suggestions for the best candidates for prompt input, submit button, and response output using selectors.\n\nFirst, looking at the HTML structure, there's no visible <input> or form element with a prompt like \"Please type your question here...\" So I'll have to look elsewhere. Since it's JavaScript that might be handling user interactions, maybe event listeners are involved.\n\nThe script uses window.__CF$cv$params which suggests some dynamic parameters. The a.src seems to point to main.js on grok.com. That script probably contains the UI components we're looking for because static HTML wouldn't have prompt and output elements.\n\nIn the main.js, I can assume that there's an input field where the user types their question and buttons to submit or generate responses. Since the selectors need to be based on the provided HTML, but since the actual content of main.js isn't given, I'll have to make educated guesses about typical HTML structures used in such scenarios.\n\nFor the prompt input, a common element is an <input type=\"text\"> with a label like \"Question:\". So maybe the selector would look for that. Even though it's not directly in the provided snippet, it's likely present in main.js where the user interacts with the prompt.\n\nNext, the submit button usually has a class or id like 'submit' or 'btn'. It's a standard form element attached to an event listener for submission.\n\nFor the response output, there's probably a div that dynamically updates when the button is clicked. Often, this is done using JavaScript to update the DOM content, so the output might be within a <div> with a class like 'output' or something similar where the response appears after submission.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create selectors based on these typical elements and their classes. The reasoning will explain why each selector is chosen, focusing on common UI patterns even without seeing the exact content of main.js.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"promptInput\": {\n    \"selector\": \".question-input\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Assuming a standard HTML structure where the prompt input would be an <input> element with a label like 'Question:'.
