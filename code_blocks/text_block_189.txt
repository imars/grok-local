It seems like you ran x_poller.py without the --headless flag (since it prompted for manual login), successfully logged in with @ianatmars, and then it polled X but didn’t find a GROK_LOCAL: command in the Grok conversation. That’s expected behavior if the conversation at GROK_URL doesn’t yet have a command for grok-local to process. However, since you want to implement a headless login, let’s modify x_poller.py to automate the login process without manual intervention, which will work seamlessly in headless mode.
